.TH DROTATE 1
.SH NAME
drotate \- archives all files and subdirectories older than a
defineable age and deletes them.
.SH SYNOPSIS
If the directory to rotate is specified in the config file:

.B drotate
[\-d dir] [\-o dir] [\-a file] [\-i days] [\-c configfile] [\-m file]
[\-psnfhv]

Otherwise the `-d' option is mandatory:

.B drotate
.B \-d dir
[\-o dir] [\-a file] [\-i days] [\-c configfile] [\-m file]
[\-psnfhv]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B drotate
finds all files and directories in a given directory older than
a certain number of days and marked by a dotfile and then archives
and deletes (rotates) them. It can be used to archive regularly
accumulating files that don't need to be in direct access forever
and can be archived after some time.
.PP
.B drotate
can be periodically called on a daily/weekly/monthly basis but
rotation will only be performed when the last rotation dates
back a given amount of days.
.SH OPTIONS
Everything can be configured in a configuration file. The only
mandatory parameter is the name of the directory
.B drotate
shall process. If you want to do without a configuration file,
you have to pass at least the name of the directory to process
with the `-d' option.
.IP \-d\ dir
specifies the directory to process (archive directory).
.B drotate
then descends into all subdirectories (unless `-d' is used)
and finds directories marked with a dotfile '.drotate'. Only
the directories found will be considered for rotation.
.IP \-o\ dir
specifies where to save the archive file (output directory).
The default is to save the archive to the current directory. Do
note that this output directory and the archive directory must
not be the same.
.IP \-a\ file
specifies an alternate name for the resulting archive. See
the
.B DEFAULTS
section on the default archive name.
.IP \-i\ days
the interval to use for rotation. This serves two purposes. In
the first place it specifies how old files and directories have
to be in order for them to be rotated. At the same time this
value determines if the rotation will take place at all (certain
amount of time must have passed between two rotations).
.IP \-g
tests for access time instead of modification time when
determining the age of a file.
.IP \-p
prepends the hostname to the archive filename.
.IP \-c\ file
reads an alternate/additional configuration file.
.IP \-n
performs a dry run, i.e. doesn't touch
anything and just to shows what would be done.
.IP \-k
keeps archived files, instead of deleting them.
.IP \-f
forces overwriting of an existing archive. Default is to
terminate if an archive already exists.
.IP \-F
forces execution, even if necessary waiting time has not yet been
reached.
.IP \-h
displays help information. Verbosity can be increased by
using the `-v' switch.
.IP \-v
increases verbosity.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B drotate
reads the configuration file at
.B $HOME/.drotate.conf
at startup if it exists.
If additional configuration files are provided with the `-c'
option, these are read in the provided order.
.PP
The definitions can be overridden by providing the appropriate
options on the command line.
.PP
The configuration variables have to be set like this:

.B VARIABLE=value

Notice that some values need to be quoted.
.PP
.B drotate
recognizes the following options (for a description see
the
.B OPTIONS
section):
.TP
.B DIR
the directory to process
.TP
.B ARCHDIR
where to save the archive file
.TP
.B ARCHFILE
alternate name for the resulting archive
.TP
.B INTERVAL
interval of rotation
.TP
.B ACCESS
tests for access time instead of modification time when determining
the age of a file
.TP
.B PREPEND
prepends the hostname to archive files
.TP
.B DRYRUN
tells drotate to perform a dry run, i.e. not to touch
anything and just to show what would be done.
.TP
.B KEEP
keeps archived files instead of deleting them
.TP
.B OVERWRITE
switch to overwrite an existing archive
.TP
.B LASTROTATEFILE
defines another name for the state file
.TP
.B VERBOSE
enables verbose output
.TP
.B FORCE
forces execution

.SH DEFAULTS
.IP Interval
The default interval is 150 days.
.IP Archive\ filename
The default archive filename has this format:

.B     [HOSTNAME_]directory-path_YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm.tar.gz  

whereas the directory-path is specified by the `-d' switch
or the DIR config file variable. YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm reflects
the current system time. If the hostname is to be prepended,
it is determined by the `hostname' command.
.IP Archive\ directory
The default directory the archive file is saved to is
the current working directory.
.IP State\ file
The default name of the state file is `.lastdrotate'. It
is saved in the directory to process.
.IP Prepending\ of\ hostname
The default is no to prepend the hostname.
.IP Descend\ into\ subdirectories
The default is to descend into subdirectories.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B drotate
exits with status 0 if the rotation completed successfully. It
exits with 1 if an operating error occurred and with 2 if one
of the backend tools exited unexpectedly. If the archive file
already exists but drotate must not overwrite it, it exits with 3.
.SH BACKEND TOOLS
drotate requires the following backend tools to work:
.TP
* find
.TP
* mktemp
.TP
* tr
.TP
* sed
.TP
* pwd
.TP
* cat
.TP
* tac
.TP
* hostname
.TP
* wc
.TP
* dirname

.PP
The availability of the following tools is optional but recommended:
.TP
* tput, to get the number of columns if $COLUMNS isn't set
.TP
* fold, to prevent line-breaks within word-boundaries
