.TH DROTATE 1
.SH NAME
drotate \- archives and deletes (rotates) files and directories
older than a given age 
.SH SYNOPSIS
If the directory to rotate is specified in the config file:

.B drotate
[\-d dir] [\-o dir] [\-a file] [\-i days] [\-c configfile] [\-m file]
[\-psnfhv]

Otherwise the `-d' option is mandatory:

.B drotate
.B \-d dir
[\-o dir] [\-a file] [\-i days] [\-c configfile] [\-m file]
[\-psnfhv]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B drotate
recursively finds all files and directories in a given directory
older than a certain number of days and archives and deletes
(rotates) them.
It can be used to archive regularly accumulating files that
don't need to be in direct access forever and can be archived
after some time.
.PP
.B drotate
can be automatically called on a daily/weekly/monthly basis
but the rotation will only happen when the last rotation dates
back a given amount of days. This prevents the creation of
many small archives and allows periodic execution via cron.
.SH OPTIONS
Everything can be configured in a configuration file. The only
mandatory parameter is the name of the directory
.B drotate
shall process. If you want to do without a configuration file,
you have to pass at least the name of the directory to process
with the `-d' option.
.IP \-d\ dir
specifies the directory to process. Everything in it will
be considered for rotation. The directory itself and the
contained state file will never be subject to rotation.
.IP \-o\ dir
specifies where to save the archive file. Default is to save
the archive to the current directory.
.IP \-a\ file
specifies an alternate name for the resulting archive. See
the
.B DEFAULTS
section on the default archive name.
.IP \-i\ days
tells
.B drotate
which interval to use for rotation. This serves two purposes. In
the first place it specifies how old files and directories have
to be in order for them to be rotated. At the same time this
value determines if the rotation will take place at all (certain
amount of time must have passed between two rotations).
.IP \-g
tests for access time instead of modification time when
determining the age of a file.
.IP \-p
prepends the hostname to the archive filename.
.IP \-c\ file
reads an alternate/additional configuration file.
.IP \-m\ file
multiplex mode: reads given file which holds a list of drotate
configuration files and starts a drotate instance for each one
of them. drotate ignores any command line configuration in this mode.
.IP \-n
performs a dry run, i.e. doesn't touch
anything and just to shows what would be done.
.IP \-k
keeps archived files, instead of deleting them.
.IP \-f
forces overwriting of an existing archive. Default is to
terminate if an archive already exists.
.IP \-s
prevents
.B drotate
from descending into subdirectories
.IP \-h
displays help information. Verbosity can be increased by
using the `-v' switch.
.IP \-v
increases verbosity.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B drotate
reads the configuration file at
.B $HOME/.drotate.conf
at startup if it exists.
If additional configuration files are provided with the `-c'
option, these are read in the provided order.
.PP
The definitions can be overridden by providing the appropriate
options at runtime.
.PP
The configuration variables have to be set like this:

.B VARIABLE=value

Notice that some values need to be quoted.
.PP
.B drotate
recognizes the following options (for a description see
the
.B OPTIONS
section):
.TP
.B DIR
specifies the directory to process.
.TP
.B ARCHDIR
specifies where to save the archive file.
.TP
.B ARCHFILE
specifies an alternate name for the resulting archive.
.TP
.B INTERVAL
specifies the interval of rotation.
.TP
.B ACCESS
tells drotate to test for access time instead of modification 
time when determining the age of a file.
.TP
.B PREPEND
tells drotate to prepend the hostname.
.TP
.B DRYRUN
tells drotate to perform a dry run, i.e. not to touch
anything and just to show what would be done.
.TP
.B KEEP
tells drotate to keep archived files, instead of deleting them.
.TP
.B MULTPLEX
puts drotate in multiplex mode, see `-m' above.
.TP
.B DESCEND
whether to descend into subdirectories
.TP
.B OVERWRITE
tells drotate to overwrite an existing archive.
.TP
.B LASTROTATEFILE
tells drotate to use another name for the state file.
.TP
.B VERBOSE
tells drotate to be verbose.
.SH DEFAULTS
.IP Interval
The default interval is 150 days.
.IP Archive\ filename
The default archive filename has this format:

.B     [HOSTNAME_]directory-path_YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm.tar.gz  

whereas the directory-path is specified by the `-d' switch
or the DIR config file variable. YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm reflects
the current system time. If the hostname is to be prepended,
it is determined by the `hostname' command.
.IP Archive\ directory
The default directory the archive file is saved to is
the current working directory.
.IP State\ file
The default name of the state file is `.lastdrotate'. It
is saved in the directory to process.
.IP Prepending\ of\ hostname
The default is no to prepend the hostname.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B drotate
exits with status 0 if the rotation completed successfully. It
exits with 1 if an operating error occurred and with 2 if one
of the backend tools exited unexpectedly. If the archive file
already exists but drotate must not overwrite it, it exits with 3.
.SH BACKEND TOOLS
drotate requires the following backend tools to work:
.TP
*
find, to find files to rotate
.TP
*
mktemp, to create temporary files
.TP
*
tr, to process lists of filenames delimited by the NULL character
.TP
*
sed, to create a nice default archive name
.TP
*
pwd, to get the current working directory if $PWD isn't set
.TP
*
cat, to output the list of filenames
.TP
*
tac, to output the list of directories in reverse order
.TP
*
hostname, to get the hostname of the system
.TP
*
wc, to count the number of directories and files to be processed
.PP
The availability of the following tools is optional but recommended:
.TP
*
tput, to get the number of columns if $COLUMNS isn't set
.TP
*
fold, to prevent line-breaks within word-boundaries
