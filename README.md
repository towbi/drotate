# drotate

drotate archives and deletes (rotates) files and directories older than a
given age.

## Description

*drotate* recursively finds all files and directories in a given directory
older than a certain number of days and archives and deletes (rotates)
them.  It can be used to archive regularly accumulating files  that  don't
need to be in direct access forever and can be archived after some time.

*drotate* can  be  automatically called on a daily/weekly/monthly basis but
the rotation will only happen when the last rotation dates back a given
amount of days. This prevents the creation of many  small  archives  and
allows periodic execution via cron.

See the man-page for detailed information on usage and options.
